## Setup

**1. Install Nugs CLI:**

The binary is already installed at `/home/jmagar/workspace/nugs/nugs`.

**2. Configure credentials in `~/.nugs/config.json`:**

```json
{
  "email": "your-email@example.com",
  "password": "your-password",
  "outPath": "/path/to/downloads",
  "format": 2,
  "videoFormat": 3,
  "defaultOutputs": "audio",
  "catalogAutoRefresh": true,
  "catalogRefreshTime": "05:00",
  "catalogRefreshTimezone": "America/New_York",
  "catalogRefreshInterval": "daily"
}
```

**Format Options:**
- Audio: `1` = ALAC, `2` = FLAC (recommended), `3` = MQA, `4` = 360RA, `5` = AAC
- Video: `1` = 480p, `2` = 720p, `3` = 1080p (recommended), `4` = 1440p, `5` = 4K
- Default Outputs: `audio` (default), `video`, or `both`

**3. Set secure permissions:**

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.nugs/config.json
```

**4. Update catalog cache (first run):**

```bash
/home/jmagar/workspace/nugs/nugs update
```

**Optional - Rclone Integration:**

Add to config.json for automatic cloud uploads:

```json
{
  "rcloneEnabled": true,
  "rcloneRemote": "gdrive",
  "rclonePath": "/Music/Nugs",
  "deleteAfterUpload": false,
  "rcloneTransfers": 4

/home/jmagar/workspace/nugs/nugs cache --json standard
/home/jmagar/workspace/nugs/nugs stats --json standard

# Pipe to jq for filtering
/home/jmagar/workspace/nugs/nugs list 1125 --json standard | jq '.shows[:5]'
```

## Workflow

When the user asks about Nugs.net or live music downloads:

1. **"Download [Artist] shows"**
   - If specific show: `nugs grab <show_id>`
   - If latest shows: `nugs grab <artist_id> latest`
   - If entire catalog: `nugs <artist_id> full`

2. **"What Billy Strings shows do I have?"**
   - Run: `nugs list 1125`
   - Then optionally: `nugs coverage 1125` for statistics

3. **"Find missing [Artist] shows"**
   - Run: `nugs gaps <artist_id>`
   - Ask if user wants to download all: `nugs gaps <artist_id> fill`
   - Or pipe to download: `nugs gaps <artist_id> --ids-only | xargs -n1 nugs grab`

4. **"Show me Red Rocks concerts"**
   - Run: `nugs list <artist_id> "Red Rocks"`
   - Present results with show IDs
   - Offer to download specific shows

5. **"What's new on Nugs?"**
   - Run: `nugs latest` (shows last 15 additions)
   - Or: `nugs latest 50` for more results

6. **"Update my catalog"**
   - Run: `nugs update`
   - Then: `nugs stats` to show catalog summary

### Decision Tree for Downloads

```
User requests download
    │
    ├─→ Specific show ID known?
    │   └─→ Yes: `nugs grab <id>`
    │
    ├─→ Artist catalog request?
    │   ├─→ Latest only: `nugs grab <artist_id> latest`
    │   └─→ Full catalog: `nugs <artist_id> full`
    │
    ├─→ Missing shows (gaps)?
    │   ├─→ View gaps: `nugs gaps <artist_id>`
    │   └─→ Auto-fill: `nugs gaps <artist_id> fill`
    │
    └─→ Search by venue/date?
        └─→ `nugs list <artist_id> "venue"` → Select IDs → Download
```

## Common Artist IDs

For quick reference:

| Artist ID | Artist Name |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1125 | Billy Strings |
| 461 | Grateful Dead |
| 1045 | Phish |
| 22 | Umphrey's McGee |
| 1084 | Spafford |
| 1299 | Dead & Company |
| 1046 | Widespread Panic |
| 4 | The String Cheese Incident |

Find more with: `nugs list --json standard | jq '.artists[] | {id, name, showCount}'`

## Notes

**Catalog Cache:**
- Location: `~/.cache/nugs/`
- Files: `catalog.json`, `by-artist.json`, `by-date.json`, `catalog-meta.json`
- Update frequency: Auto-refresh (configurable) or manual with `nugs update`
- Size: ~7-8 MB
- Shows: 13,000+ concerts

**Download Behavior:**
- Downloads are skipped if already exist (based on file path)
- Gap detection checks both local storage and rclone remote
- Rclone uploads happen automatically after successful downloads (if enabled)
- Failed downloads can be retried (just run the command again)

**Performance:**
- Catalog operations are instant (local cache)
- Downloads depend on your internet speed and Nugs.net servers
- Batch downloads process sequentially (no parallel downloads)
- Large catalogs (500+ shows) can take hours to download

**Permissions:**
- Downloading requires active Nugs.net subscription
- Some shows may be unavailable based on subscription tier
- Videos may require higher subscription level
- Only download content you have legal access to

**FFmpeg Requirement:**
- Required for video downloads (TS → MP4 conversion)
- Required for HLS-only audio tracks
- Install: `sudo apt install ffmpeg` (Linux) or `brew install ffmpeg` (macOS)

**Security:**
- Config file contains plaintext credentials
- Always use `chmod 600 ~/.nugs/config.json`
- Never commit config file to version control
- For Apple/Google accounts, use token authentication ([guide](https://github.com/jmagar/nugs-cli/blob/main/token.md))
