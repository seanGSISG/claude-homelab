## Status Icons

| Icon | Status | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| ✓ | reachable | URL responded (any HTTP code except timeout) |
| ⚠ | unreachable | URL configured but timed out or connection refused |
| ○ | not configured | No URL set in `~/.claude-homelab/.env` |

## Follow-Up Actions

After showing the dashboard, offer context-sensitive help:

- **Unreachable services**: "Want me to help diagnose `sonarr`? I can check if the URL is correct or test the connection."
- **Not configured services**: "You have 5 services not configured. Want to set them up now?" → offer to run `/homelab-core:setup`
- **All reachable**: "Everything looks good! All configured services are responding."

## Refresh

If the user asks to recheck a specific service, re-run the script and filter the output for that service. Don't run the full check for a single-service query.
