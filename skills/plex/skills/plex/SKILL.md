# Plex Media Server Skill

**⚠️ MANDATORY SKILL INVOCATION ⚠️**

**YOU MUST invoke this skill (NOT optional) when the user mentions ANY of these triggers:**
- "Plex library", "search Plex", "what's on Plex"
- "Plex sessions", "who's watching", "active streams"
- "browse Plex", "check Plex", "Plex status"
- Any mention of Plex Media Server or querying media

**Failure to invoke this skill when triggers occur violates your operational requirements.**

Control and query Plex Media Server using the Plex API. Browse libraries, search media, and monitor active sessions.

## Purpose

This skill provides **read-only** access to your Plex Media Server:
- Browse library sections (Movies, TV, Music, Photos)
- Search for specific media
- View recently added content
- Check what's currently playing (active sessions)
- View "On Deck" (continue watching)
- List available clients/players

All operations are **GET-only** and safe for monitoring/browsing.

## Setup

Add your Plex server credentials to `~/.claude-homelab/.env`:

```bash
# Plex Media Server
PLEX_URL="http://192.168.1.100:32400"
PLEX_TOKEN="YOUR_PLEX_TOKEN"
```

- `PLEX_URL`: Your Plex server URL with port (default: 32400)
- `PLEX_TOKEN`: Your Plex authentication token

**Getting your Plex token:**
1. Go to plex.tv → Account → Authorized Devices
2. Click on any device, then "View XML"
3. Find `X-Plex-Token` in the URL
4. Or: Open any media in Plex Web, click "Get Info" → "View XML" and find token in URL

## Commands

All commands output JSON. Use `jq` for formatting or filtering.

The `plex-api.sh` helper script simplifies API access. Located at: `skills/plex/scripts/plex-api.sh`

### Server Info

```bash
# Using helper script
./skills/plex/scripts/plex-api.sh info

# Or raw curl
curl -s "$PLEX_URL/?X-Plex-Token=$PLEX_TOKEN" -H "Accept: application/json"
```

### Browse Libraries

List all library sections:

```bash
# Using helper script
./skills/plex/scripts/plex-api.sh libraries

# Or raw curl
curl -s "$PLEX_URL/library/sections?X-Plex-Token=$PLEX_TOKEN" -H "Accept: application/json"
```

### List Library Contents

```bash
# Using helper script (replace 1 with your section key)
./skills/plex/scripts/plex-api.sh library 1
./skills/plex/scripts/plex-api.sh library 1 --limit 50 --offset 100

# Or raw curl
curl -s "$PLEX_URL/library/sections/1/all?X-Plex-Token=$PLEX_TOKEN" -H "Accept: application/json"
```

### Search Media

```bash
# Using helper script
./skills/plex/scripts/plex-api.sh search "Inception"
./skills/plex/scripts/plex-api.sh search "Avengers" --limit 10

# Or raw curl
curl -s "$PLEX_URL/search?query=SEARCH_TERM&X-Plex-Token=$PLEX_TOKEN" -H "Accept: application/json"
```

### Recently Added

```bash
# Using helper script (default: 20 items)
./skills/plex/scripts/plex-api.sh recent
./skills/plex/scripts/plex-api.sh recent --limit 10

# Or raw curl
curl -s "$PLEX_URL/library/recentlyAdded?X-Plex-Token=$PLEX_TOKEN" -H "Accept: application/json"
```

### On Deck (Continue Watching)

```bash
# Using helper script (default: 10 items)
./skills/plex/scripts/plex-api.sh ondeck
./skills/plex/scripts/plex-api.sh ondeck --limit 5

# Or raw curl
curl -s "$PLEX_URL/library/onDeck?X-Plex-Token=$PLEX_TOKEN" -H "Accept: application/json"
```

### Active Sessions (What's Playing)

```bash
# Using helper script
./skills/plex/scripts/plex-api.sh sessions

# Or raw curl
curl -s "$PLEX_URL/status/sessions?X-Plex-Token=$PLEX_TOKEN" -H "Accept: application/json"
```

### List Clients/Players

```bash
# Using helper script
./skills/plex/scripts/plex-api.sh clients

# Or raw curl
curl -s "$PLEX_URL/clients?X-Plex-Token=$PLEX_TOKEN" -H "Accept: application/json"
```

### Additional Commands

```bash
# Server identity
./skills/plex/scripts/plex-api.sh identity

# Get metadata for specific item (by rating key)
./skills/plex/scripts/plex-api.sh metadata 12345

# Get children of item (e.g., seasons of a TV show)
./skills/plex/scripts/plex-api.sh children 12345

# List playlists
./skills/plex/scripts/plex-api.sh playlists

# Refresh library section (scan for new media)
./skills/plex/scripts/plex-api.sh refresh 1

# View all commands
./skills/plex/scripts/plex-api.sh --help
```

## Workflow

When the user asks about Plex:

1. **"What's on Plex?"** → Browse libraries and show section overview
2. **"Search for Inception"** → Run search with query
3. **"What was recently added?"** → Run recentlyAdded
4. **"Who's watching right now?"** → Run sessions
5. **"What am I watching?"** → Run onDeck
6. **"List my movies"** → List library sections, then contents of Movies section

### Library Section Types

Common section types (keys vary by server):
- **Movies** — Usually section 1
- **TV Shows** — Usually section 2
- **Music** — Music library
- **Photos** — Photo library

Always list sections first to get the correct section keys for your server.

## Output Format

- Add `-H "Accept: application/json"` for JSON output
- Default output is XML if header not specified
- Media keys look like `/library/metadata/12345`
- Use `jq` to filter and format JSON responses

## Notes

- Requires network access to your Plex server
- All calls are **read-only GET requests**
- Library section keys (1, 2, 3...) vary by server setup — list sections first
- Playback control is possible but not implemented (safety)
- Always confirm before triggering playback on remote devices
- Token is scoped to your account — keep it secure

## Multiple Servers

To query multiple Plex servers:

```bash
# Server 1
PLEX_URL="http://server1:32400" PLEX_TOKEN="token1" curl ...

# Server 2
PLEX_URL="http://server2:32400" PLEX_TOKEN="token2" curl ...
```

## 🔧 Agent Tool Usage Requirements

**CRITICAL:** When invoking scripts from this skill via the zsh-tool, **ALWAYS use `pty: true`**.

Without PTY mode, command output will not be visible even though commands execute successfully.

**Correct invocation pattern:**
```typescript
<invoke name="mcp__plugin_zsh-tool_zsh-tool__zsh">
<parameter name="command">./skills/SKILL_NAME/scripts/SCRIPT.sh [args]</parameter>
<parameter name="pty">true</parameter>
</invoke>
```
