# Agentic Research — Shared Team Playbook

This is the shared playbook loaded by ALL agents in the agentic research system. It defines the protocols, quality standards, and conventions that ensure consistent, high-quality research across the orchestrator and all specialist agents.

**Every agent MUST read and follow this playbook before beginning work.**

## Team Structure

| Agent | Role | Key Tools |
|-------|------|-----------|
| **Orchestrator** | Coordinates workflow, relays URLs, synthesizes report | TeamCreate, SendMessage, Task |
| **ExaAI Specialist** | Semantic web search, source discovery | mcp__exa__web_search_exa |
| **Firecrawl Specialist** | Web scraping, site crawling, vector DB | firecrawl CLI, Qdrant |
| **NotebookLM Specialist** | AI-powered analysis, artifact generation | notebooklm CLI |

## Communication Protocol

### Message Format

All inter-agent messages MUST use this structure:

```
## [Agent Name] [Message Type] (Batch N)

### [Section 1 Header]
- Item 1
- Item 2

### [Section 2 Header]
- Item 1

### Summary
Brief summary of key points.
```

### Message Types

| Type | When | From | To |
|------|------|------|----|
| **URL Report** | Every 3-5 operations | Specialists | Orchestrator |
| **Progress Update** | Every 5-10 operations | Specialists | Orchestrator |
| **Crawl Request** | When docs site discovered | Orchestrator | Firecrawl |
| **Source Relay** | When high-quality URLs received | Orchestrator | NotebookLM |
| **Completion Signal** | When all work done | Specialists | Orchestrator |
| **Error Escalation** | When blocked | Any agent | Orchestrator |

### URL Report Format (Specialists -> Orchestrator)

```
## [Agent] URL Report (Batch N)

### Key URLs Discovered:
- https://url1.com - [Description] - Tier: [Primary/Academic/Official/Industry/Community]
- https://url2.com - [Description] - Tier: [tier]

### Documentation Sites (recommend for Firecrawl):
- https://docs.example.com - Full documentation for X

### Key Findings:
- Finding 1
- Finding 2
```

### Source Relay Format (Orchestrator -> NotebookLM)

```
Add these N sources to the notebook:
- https://url1.com — [Description] — Tier: Primary
- https://url2.com — [Description] — Tier: Academic
```

### Completion Signal Format

```
[Agent] specialist complete. Findings written to findings/[agent]-findings.md.
[Key stats: searches, URLs, pages, etc.]
Key gaps: [list gaps].
```

## Source Quality Tiers

All agents MUST classify discovered sources using these tiers. The orchestrator uses tiers to prioritize which URLs to relay to NotebookLM.

| Tier | Description | Priority | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Primary** | Original research, official announcements, creator content | Highest | Blog posts by framework creators, official release notes, original research papers |
| **Academic** | Peer-reviewed papers, university research, conference proceedings | High | arXiv papers, ACM/IEEE publications, NeurIPS/ICML proceedings |
| **Official** | Official documentation, guides, tutorials from project maintainers | High | docs.langchain.com, readthedocs sites, official GitHub READMEs |
| **Industry** | Analysis from recognized industry analysts, reputable tech publications | Medium | Hacker News (top posts), reputable tech blogs, benchmark reports |
| **Community** | Forum discussions, personal blogs, Stack Overflow, Reddit | Lower | Reddit threads, personal dev blogs, community wikis |
| **News** | News articles, press releases, general media coverage | Lowest | TechCrunch, The Verge, general news sites |

### Tier Prioritization Rules

1. **Primary + Academic**: Always relay to NotebookLM
2. **Official**: Always relay to NotebookLM (essential for technical accuracy)
3. **Industry**: Relay if relevant to key questions and not redundant
4. **Community**: Only relay if contains unique insights not found in higher tiers
5. **News**: Rarely relay -- only if contains exclusive information

### Source Limit Management

- **NotebookLM limit**: 300 sources (paid plan), 50 (standard)
- **Target**: 200 excellent sources > 300 mediocre ones
- **Track count**: Orchestrator maintains running total
- **Stop early**: If quality sources are exhausted before hitting limit

See [references/source-quality-tiers.md](references/source-quality-tiers.md) for detailed tier classification examples.

## Parallel Safety Rules

### NotebookLM Commands

**CRITICAL: ALL agents MUST follow these rules.**

- **ALWAYS** use `-n <notebook_id>` or `--notebook <notebook_id>` flags
- **NEVER** use `notebooklm use <id>` -- it modifies shared state and is unsafe in parallel workflows
- **Use full UUIDs** in automation to avoid ambiguity from partial IDs
- **Use `--new` flag** on `ask` commands when switching topic areas (avoids conversation ID conflicts)

### File System Safety

- Each specialist writes to its own findings file (no conflicts):
  - ExaAI: `findings/exa-findings.md`
  - Firecrawl: `findings/firecrawl-findings.md`
  - NotebookLM: `findings/notebooklm-findings.md`
- Only the orchestrator writes to `report.md` and `sources/sources.md`
- Artifacts are downloaded to `artifacts/` (NotebookLM specialist only)

### Team Communication Safety

- All messages go through SendMessage tool (not shared files)
- Messages are automatically delivered -- no polling needed
- Each agent maintains its own state independently
- The orchestrator is the only agent that reads all findings files (during synthesis)

## Output Formatting Standards

### Findings Files

All specialist findings files MUST include:

1. **Research Topic** -- exact topic from brief
2. **Methodology Summary** -- what was done, key stats
3. **Key Findings** -- organized by topic area, with inline source URLs
4. **Contradictions** -- where sources disagree (do NOT smooth over)
5. **Gaps** -- what couldn't be found or needs more investigation

### Source Citation Format

Inline citations use markdown links:

```markdown
According to the official documentation [Source Title](https://url), the framework supports...
```

When citing multiple sources:

```markdown
Multiple sources confirm this approach [Source A](url1), [Source B](url2), though [Source C](url3) disagrees.
```

### URL Reporting Format

When reporting URLs, always include:
- Full URL (no shortlinks)
- Brief description (what the page contains)
- Quality tier classification

```
- https://docs.example.com/guide - Comprehensive setup guide - Tier: Official
```

## Error Handling Protocol

### Severity Levels

| Level | Action | Examples |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Warning** | Log and continue | Rate limit on one site, single source fails to load |
| **Error** | Report to orchestrator, attempt workaround | Auth failure, major site blocked, tool crash |
| **Critical** | Report to orchestrator immediately, stop work | All tools failing, auth completely broken |

### Error Reporting Format

```
## Error Report

**Agent:** [name]
**Severity:** [Warning/Error/Critical]
**Error:** [description]
**Action Taken:** [what you tried]
**Impact:** [what's affected]
**Suggested Fix:** [if known]
```

### Recovery Strategies

1. **Rate limits**: Exponential backoff (30s -> 2min -> skip)
2. **Auth failures**: Run diagnostic commands, report to orchestrator
3. **Tool crashes**: Retry once, then report
4. **Network issues**: Wait 1 minute, retry, then report
5. **Source not found**: Log, skip, continue with other sources

## Persistent Memory Conventions

All agents write session learnings to `~/.claude/memory/`:

| Agent | Memory File |
|-------|-------------|
| Orchestrator | `~/.claude/memory/agentic-orchestrator.md` |
| ExaAI | `~/.claude/memory/exa-specialist.md` |
| Firecrawl | `~/.claude/memory/firecrawl-specialist.md` |
| NotebookLM | `~/.claude/memory/notebooklm-specialist.md` |

### Memory Entry Format

```markdown
## Session: YYYY-MM-DD -- <topic-slug>

**What worked:**
- [insight 1]
- [insight 2]

**What didn't work:**
- [issue 1]

**Lessons learned:**
- [lesson 1]
```

### Memory Usage

- **Read memory at session start** to leverage past learnings
- **Write memory at session end** with insights from current session
- Keep entries concise -- focus on actionable insights
- Update or remove entries that turn out to be wrong
