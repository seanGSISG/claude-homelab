# Save Session Documentation

Document the **entire conversation session** (not just recent work) as a markdown file at `$ARGUMENTS`. If no path is provided, save to `docs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-description.md` in the current working directory.

Path safety rules:
- Keep this workflow in-repo. If the target is outside the current repo root, stop and report the path issue.
- If the target filename already exists, do not overwrite. Append a suffix like `-v2`, `-v3`, etc.

## Documentation Requirements

Include in the markdown file:
1. **Session Overview**: Brief summary of what was accomplished
2. **Timeline**: Chronological breakdown of major activities
3. **Key Findings**: Important discoveries with file paths and line numbers where relevant
4. **Technical Decisions**: Reasoning behind implementation choices
5. **Files Modified**: List of all files created/modified with purpose
6. **Commands Executed**: Critical bash commands and their results
7. **Behavior Changes (Before/After)**: User-visible or system-visible behavior changes caused by this session
8. **Verification Evidence**: Table with `command | expected | actual | status`
9. **Source IDs + Collections Touched**: Every embed/retrieve source ID and collection used, with outcome
10. **Risks and Rollback**: Concise risk notes and rollback path for non-trivial changes
11. **Decisions Not Taken**: Alternatives considered but rejected, with brief rationale
12. **Open Questions**: Unresolved items or assumptions that need follow-up
13. **Next Steps**: Any remaining tasks or follow-up items

Content quality rules:
- Facts only. Do not infer values that were not observed in tool/command output.
- If something is uncertain, place it in **Open Questions** instead of stating it as fact.
- Keep sections concise (target max 5 bullets per section), but exceed when needed to preserve material implementation details, critical evidence, or safety context.
- Use file:line references (e.g., `server.ts:45`) for code-specific findings.

## Axon Embedding Integration (Required)

After writing the markdown file, embedding with Axon is **mandatory** (always attempt):

1. Determine the final saved path (the explicit `$ARGUMENTS` target or the default generated path under `docs/sessions/`).
2. Optional preflight (recommended, not a substitute for embedding):
   ```bash
   axon status
   ```
   - If services needed for embed/retrieve are unavailable, still continue and attempt embed/retrieve; report failures clearly and continue with markdown + Neo4j capture.
3. Run embed and capture the job ID from the initial response:
   ```bash
   axon embed "<saved-session-markdown-path>" --json
   ```
   - The initial JSON response contains `data.job_id` (and status `"queued"`) — **not** `data.url`/`data.collection`. Those are only available after the job completes.
4. Do **not** pass `--url` / `--source-id` / `--collection` for this workflow.
   - Local file embeds now derive a stable source ID automatically.
   - Local file embeds route to the repo-name collection automatically.
   - Web crawl docs remain in your configured crawl collection (e.g., `firecrawl`).
5. Poll for completion and extract source metadata:
   ```bash
   axon embed status "<job_id-from-step-3>" --json
   ```
   - Read `data.url` as the source ID and `data.collection` as the collection from **this** output (not the initial embed response).
   - Retry if status is still `"running"` or `"queued"`.
6. Verify indexing succeeded using status output values (not assumptions):
   ```bash
   axon retrieve "<source-id-from-status-data.url>" --collection "<collection-from-status-data.collection>"
   ```
   - If retrieve succeeds, embedding is confirmed.
   - If it fails, report the error and include attempted source ID + collection.
7. You must always attempt both embed and retrieve verification. If embedding fails due to environment/service availability (for example TEI/Qdrant unavailable), report the error clearly but still complete session markdown + Neo4j capture.
8. If embed succeeds but retrieve fails, mark Axon status as **partial failure** (embed success, verify failed).

## Neo4j Memory Integration

After saving the markdown file, extract and store session knowledge in Neo4j:

### Entities to Create:
- **Files**: All files created, modified, or discussed (type: "file")
- **Services**: Services deployed, configured, or debugged (type: "service")
- **Features**: Features implemented or planned (type: "feature")
- **Bugs**: Issues discovered and fixed (type: "bug")
- **Technologies**: Libraries, frameworks, tools used (type: "technology")
- **Concepts**: Important patterns, techniques, or approaches (type: "concept")

### Relations to Create:
- Files → Services: `BELONGS_TO`, `CONFIGURES`, `IMPLEMENTS`
- Features → Files: `IMPLEMENTED_IN`, `REQUIRES`
- Bugs → Files: `FOUND_IN`, `FIXED_IN`
- Technologies → Features: `USED_BY`, `ENABLES`
- Services → Technologies: `DEPENDS_ON`, `USES`

### Observations to Add:
For each entity, add observations capturing:
- What was done (e.g., "Implemented OAuth2 token refresh")
- Why it was done (e.g., "Required for persistent authentication")
- How it was done (e.g., "Used @azure/msal-node library")
- When it was done (current session date)
- Any challenges or gotchas encountered

### Payload Format Guardrail (required)
- Always send Neo4j MCP payloads as native objects, not JSON strings.
- Never wrap entities/relations/observations items as stringified JSON.
- Valid shape examples:
  - `entities: [{ name, type, observations: [...] }]`
  - `relations: [{ source, target, relationType }]`
  - `observations: [{ entityName, observations: [...] }]`
- If a Neo4j call returns a schema/model-type validation error, retry once using object literals and report the retry in the final response.

Use the neo4j-memory MCP tools:
1. `mcp__neo4j-memory__create_entities` - Create all identified entities
2. `mcp__neo4j-memory__create_relations` - Link related entities
3. `mcp__neo4j-memory__add_observations` - Enrich with session details
