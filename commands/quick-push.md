description: Git add all, commit with Claude, and push to current/new feature branch
---

## Context

- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Git status: !`git status --short`
- Remote info: !`git remote -v | head -1`

## Your task

Work through these steps in order:

### 1. Orient
- Check if we're on a feature branch (not main/master)
- If on main/master, create a new feature branch with a descriptive name based on the changes
- Run `git diff --stat HEAD` to understand the scope of changes
- Run `git log --oneline -5` to understand recent commit conventions

### 2. Bump version (before staging)

Detect the project type and bump the version based on the commit message you'll generate:

**Detection order** (use the first match):
1. `Cargo.toml` → Rust project → bump `version = "X.Y.Z"` in `[package]`
2. `package.json` → Node project → bump `"version": "X.Y.Z"`
3. `pyproject.toml` → Python project → bump `version = "X.Y.Z"` in `[project]`

**Bump rules** (based on the commit message prefix you'll draft in step 3):
- `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE` → **major** (X+1.0.0)
- `feat` or `feat(...)` → **minor** (X.Y+1.0)
- Everything else (`fix`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, etc.) → **patch** (X.Y.Z+1)

**Process:**
1. Read the current version from the manifest
2. Draft the commit message mentally (you'll finalize it in step 4)
3. Determine bump type from the commit prefix
4. Calculate the new version
5. Edit the manifest file with the new version
6. If Rust: run `cargo check` to update `Cargo.lock` (it records the version)
7. Report: `Version: X.Y.Z → A.B.C (bump type)`

**Skip conditions:**
- Version is `0.0.0` or `0.0.1` (project not yet versioned)
- No manifest file found
- The `--no-bump` flag was passed as a skill argument

### 3. Update CHANGELOG.md (before staging)
If a `CHANGELOG.md` exists in the repo root:
- Find the most recently documented commit in the changelog (look for commit hashes in the table)
- Run `git log --oneline <last_documented_sha>..HEAD` to get undocumented commits
- If there are new commits, update the changelog:
  - Add new rows to the commit summary table (newest first)
  - Update the Highlights section with grouped summaries
  - Keep the existing structure and style
- If no CHANGELOG.md exists, skip this step

### 4. Stage, commit, and push
- Stage all changes with `git add .`
- Create a meaningful commit message following the repo's conventions
- Always include Claude's co-authorship signature
- Push to remote:
  - New branch: `git push -u origin <branch>`
  - Existing branch: `git push`

### 5. Post-push: save session context
After the push succeeds, invoke the `save-to-md` skill to capture session context to Neo4j and Qdrant.

The `save-to-md` skill handles most Neo4j work, but after it completes, **always** create these additional entities and relations to wire the commit graph:

**Entities to create:**
- One entity per commit pushed this session (type: `commit`), with observations: SHA, message, branch, timestamp, files changed
- The repo itself if not already in the graph (type: `repository`), with observations: remote URL, current branch
- The session document (type: `session_doc`), with observations: file path, collection embedded into, embed job ID

**Relations to create:**
```
commit  → repository    : PUSHED_TO
commit  → session_doc   : DOCUMENTED_IN
session_doc → repository : BELONGS_TO
commit  → commit        : PRECEDED_BY   (chain commits in push order, newest → oldest)
```

Use the actual SHA, branch name, repo name, and session doc path from the work done in steps 1–5. Do not use placeholders.

---

**Notes:**
- If creating a new branch, name it based on the changes (e.g., `feat/add-user-auth`, `fix/navbar-styling`)
- The changelog update is part of the commit — it goes in the same commit as the other changes
- End with a summary of what was pushed and the branch name
