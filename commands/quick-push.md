description: Git add all, commit with Claude, and push to current/new feature branch
---

## Context

- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Git status: !`git status --short`
- Remote info: !`git remote -v | head -1`

## Your task

Work through these steps in order:

### 1. Orient
- Check if we're on a feature branch (not main/master)
- If on main/master, create a new feature branch with a descriptive name based on the changes
- Run `git diff --stat HEAD` to understand the scope of changes
- Run `git log --oneline -5` to understand recent commit conventions

### 2. Update CHANGELOG.md (before staging)
If a `CHANGELOG.md` exists in the repo root:
- Find the most recently documented commit in the changelog (look for commit hashes in the table)
- Run `git log --oneline <last_documented_sha>..HEAD` to get undocumented commits
- If there are new commits, update the changelog:
  - Add new rows to the commit summary table (newest first)
  - Update the Highlights section with grouped summaries
  - Keep the existing structure and style
- If no CHANGELOG.md exists, skip this step

### 3. Stage, commit, and push
- Stage all changes with `git add .`
- Create a meaningful commit message following the repo's conventions
- Always include Claude's co-authorship signature
- Push to remote:
  - New branch: `git push -u origin <branch>`
  - Existing branch: `git push`

### 4. Post-push: save session context
After the push succeeds, invoke the `save-to-md` skill to capture session context to Neo4j and Qdrant.

The `save-to-md` skill handles most Neo4j work, but after it completes, **always** create these additional entities and relations to wire the commit graph:

**Entities to create:**
- One entity per commit pushed this session (type: `commit`), with observations: SHA, message, branch, timestamp, files changed
- The repo itself if not already in the graph (type: `repository`), with observations: remote URL, current branch
- The session document (type: `session_doc`), with observations: file path, collection embedded into, embed job ID

**Relations to create:**
```
commit  → repository    : PUSHED_TO
commit  → session_doc   : DOCUMENTED_IN
session_doc → repository : BELONGS_TO
commit  → commit        : PRECEDED_BY   (chain commits in push order, newest → oldest)
```

Use the actual SHA, branch name, repo name, and session doc path from the work done in steps 1–4. Do not use placeholders.

**Notes:**
- If creating a new branch, name it based on the changes (e.g., `feat/add-user-auth`, `fix/navbar-styling`)
- The changelog update is part of the commit — it goes in the same commit as the other changes
- End with a summary of what was pushed and the branch name
